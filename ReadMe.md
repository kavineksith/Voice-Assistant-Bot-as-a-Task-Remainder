# Voice Assistant Documentation

## Overview

The `VoiceAssistant` Python script is a sophisticated voice-controlled application designed for managing tasks and reminders. Leveraging speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies, this script allows users to interact with a task management system through voice commands. It integrates a SQLite database to store and manage tasks, enabling functionalities such as adding, updating, deleting, searching, and viewing tasks, as well as setting and checking reminders.

## Features

- **Voice Interaction**: Utilizes `speech_recognition` for understanding voice commands and `pyttsx3` for vocal responses.
- **Task Management**: Supports adding, updating, deleting, and searching tasks with attributes such as due date and priority.
- **Reminders**: Allows users to set reminders with specific texts and times, and checks for upcoming reminders based on task priority.
- **Error Handling**: Implements custom exceptions to handle database errors, task-related issues, and general errors gracefully.
- **Persistent Storage**: Employs an SQLite database for storing task data and a text file for reminders.

## Dependencies

- **SQLite3**: For database operations.
- **SpeechRecognition**: For converting speech into text.
- **pyttsx3**: For converting text into speech.
- **Datetime**: For handling date and time-related operations.
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: For parsing commands.

Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:
```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3
```

## Usage

1. **Setup**: Ensure that the required libraries are installed and accessible.
2. **Running the Script**: Execute the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python voice_assistant.py
   ```
3. **Interaction**: Speak commands into the microphone. The assistant will process these commands and respond verbally.

- **`search_task(command)`**:
  - Searches for tasks containing the specified keyword.
  - Returns results and handles errors in search operations.

- **`view_tasks()`**:
  - Retrieves and lists all tasks from the database.

- **`set_reminder(command)`**:

## Conclusion

The `VoiceAssistant` script provides a versatile voice-controlled interface for managing tasks and reminders. Its integration of speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies makes it a user-friendly tool for hands-free task management. With robust error handling and a persistent SQLite database, the assistant offers reliable performance and easy access to task-related information. Ensure the script's dependencies are properly installed and configured for optimal functionality.
